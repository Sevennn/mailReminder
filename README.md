# mailReminder
A simple web app for reminding some task
### Intro
Make sure that your node support es6, or maybe you need to install babel-cli and run this with:  
`babel ./bin/www`  
You need to `set your smtp service username and password on models/config.js` so that  we can use it to send a mail.  
A bad news is that I can't promise that this will always work because it really depends on your mail service.  
Hence the best solution is that you can try to make a mail server of your own.

This is just fun, welcome anybody to develop it.
